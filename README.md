## Project Title

*Hello World Practice Repository* 

## Project Description

Learning how to use GitHub by creating a sample repository and advancing skills into a new programing language.

## About Me 
My name is Alex Howell and I'm currently a Junior studying Marketing and Business Analytics at the Tippie School of Business. I've played hockey for 15 years, 12 of which competitively, and hope to be able to give back to the game sometime in the future. In addition to my passion for sports, I'm also really intersted in graphic design and product development, a career path that I would really like to pursue. Being that my Marketing degree is focused more on Marketing Analytics, I felt that pairing a Business Analytics degree would do me well, so at the beginning of my Sophmore year, I began my pursuit of a Business Analytics degree.
